                    <h3>The Best Of &nbsp;Our Adelaide Wine Tours</h3>
                    <p>
                        Time and time again, South Australia’s wine regions have topped the ‘best wine regions in Australia’ lists. Adelaide Hills, Barossa Valley, and McLaren Vale are uniquely positioned and are some of the only regions that can take advantage of both warm and cool climate growing conditions. When you combine that with South Australia’s passion for pairing a drop with exquisite meals, it’s not hard to understand why tourists flock to the region to do wine tasting in Adelaide. Benders Bus Tours have been operating in the area for a while, and we’re favourites in the region for our superior service, our incredible wine tours, and our fantastic value for money. Here are a few of the highlights from each of our tours to give you an idea of what to expect when you book Benders Bus Tours for wine tasting in Adelaide.

                            <a href="adelaide-hills-wine-tour.html">Our Adelaide Hills wine tour</a> is second to none when it comes to sightseeing, incredible food, and wine tasting.

                            <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bird In Hand winery.</span> The first stop on the Adelaide Hills tour is the Bird In Hand winery. This winery is renowned in the area for their shiraz, but they also make beautiful pinot noir, chardonnay, and riesling amongst others. Bird In Hand has a very earthy, nature-rich atmosphere, making it the perfect first stop for the day.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shopping in Hahndorf.</span> If you adore German architecture, food, and history, you are going to fall in love with Hahndorf. As part of wine tasting in Adelaide Hills, we include a stop into the historic town so you can shop artisanal products to your heart's content.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mini-golf at Sidewood Wines.</span> After a long day of eating, drinking, and shopping, the perfect way to let your hair down is a round of mini-golf at Sidewood Wines. Don't expect your aim to be too fantastic!</p></li>

                        <p>
                            There are so many opportunities for <a href="barossa-wine-tour.html">wine tasting in Barossa Valley</a>; we simply couldn't put it all into one tour. You'll simply have to come back and do a second round with Bender Bus Tours if you want to experience all of the Barossa Valley. There are a couple of places, however, that are incredible enough that we had to include them on both tours.
                        </p>
    
                        <ul style="list-style: circle; margin-left: 4rem;">
                            <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Langmeil Winery.</span> The Freedom 1843 is believed to be the oldest Shiraz vineyard in the world, and you can find it at Langmeil Winery in the Barossa Valley. You'll have the opportunity to experience the rich history of this incredible winery and sample some of the finest wines in Australia.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kies Family Wines.</span> Kies Family Wines are just as renowned for their food and cafe as they are for their incredible wines. Both our Barossa Valley tours have the option to stop in at this family-owned winery for a bite to eat and to sample their vast range of vintages.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Woodstock Winery.</span> If you're looking for a wine that is unashamedly Australian in origin and captures the essence of McLaren Vale, you can't go past the vintages on offer at Woodstock Winery. Visiting this vineyard is a truly wonderful experience, which is why we offer it on both of our tours wine tasting in McLaren Vale.</p></li>

                        <p>
                            You can't do wine tasting in Adelaide without visiting the McLaren Vale region. Much like our Barossa Valley tours, we couldn't narrow down all the marvellous wineries, cafes, and shops into one tour, so we've spread them out over two. There are a couple of destinations, however, that make appearances on both tours.
